<!-- Paragragh 1-->
<p class="one"> A project driven by passion. </p>
<p class="two"> The purpose of this enterprise is to educate people on the damaging effects of pollution and find reasonable solutions to improve the health of the ecosystems surrounding them. </p>
<p class="three"> Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances in nature. There are five main types of pollution that humans contribute to daily:</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Water pollution</li>
  <li> Air pollution  </li>
  <li> Soil pollution  </li>
  <li> Noise pollution </li>
  <li> Light pollution </li>
</ul>
<p class="four"> Air, soil, and water pollution contribute to climate change and have a negative impact on human health. Pollutants also endanger many plant and animal species.</p>
<h2> Water Pollution</h2>
<p class="five"> Pollutants in water bodies caused by trash, sewage or oil spills, construction sites, and factories affect native plant and animal species. Drinking contaminated water caused by sewage overflow may cause sickness and digestive problems in humans. Pollutants such as mercury in fish and seafood can lead to serious health problems.</p>

<h2> Soil Pollution </h2>
<p class= "six"> Polluted soil puts animals and plants in danger. Soil polluted by chemicals eventually becomes infertile and unable to support crops and other plant life. If soil pollutants produce contaminated food those consuming it may become ill. Toxic soil may also cause illness through skin contact or inhalation.</p>
